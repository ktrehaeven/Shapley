# Shapley
For all my Shapley scripts and issues
#
The files are separated by observing band and reduction software. For imaging with DDFacet, the primary beam models need to be generated from scratch using the make_new_mkt_pb_files.avg_only.py script. I suggest making separate virtual environments for caracal, stimela2 and DDFacet+killMS. Please refer to the CARACal and Stimela2 docs for how to run the scripts. If you have any trouble running the scripts you are welcome to contact me at ktrehaeven@gmail.com
